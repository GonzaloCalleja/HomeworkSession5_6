## Homework for sessions 5 & 6

1) Print the multiplication table 1-10 without duplicates (if a*b=c appears, then b*a=c should not)
2) Suppose you can only do additions. Write a program that reads two positive, integer numbers a and b. It computes a**b.
3) Read an int number. Check if the number is a palindrome. (A palindrome number read backwards has the same value. Example of palindrome numbers: 123454321, 999, 1598951)

4) Magic Maze
